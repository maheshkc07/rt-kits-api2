I signed into sync  as usual because this is not the first time I've had to do this over the last few years actually about two months ago I did the exact same thing to another computer with no issues on the same account. This time however sync did everything except for all my add ins after waiting, trying to find solutions online etc. etc. gave up, but gave it 24 hours more to try to figure out what was going on. Ran across a few articles that Firefox 79 change something with sync but don't understand exactly what they're talking about why this would affect this installation, so I then looked at  the versions installed on each system, my main system is running Firefox 78 or I should say was running Firefox 78 I thought upgrading it to 79 would fix the issue so I did and that did not work. in the meantime I proceeded to uninstall Firefox 79 on the second machine that refuses to sync the add-ons and replace it with Firefox 78, during this process I removed all Firefox entries related to profiles installs updates etc. I tried to wipe every mention of Firefox on the machine as if it never have Firefox installed on it before. Installed 78 signed in to sink expecting everything to work as normal and still nothing it's been two hours since the install I have re-synced multiple times in hopes of getting it to work with no success it appears to sync everything but the add-ons, and yes I have add-ons on the sync list on all computers have double triple and quadruple checked that to make sure . I really don't want to have to manually run from computer to computer to figure out what add-ons I have and all the settings of each one to make it perfect because I have had issues in the past of installing an add-on on one machine and the settings being different on another causing issues between the add-ons would appreciate if somebody could tell me how why or what the hell I'm supposed to do here to make Firefox think actually work again the way it had worked for years I really need these computers identical in every way as i am disabled and have mobility issues such related to all be installing and uninstalling.

Thanks againI just noticed that there's troubleshooting information able to be shared this information is being shared from the computer that works absolutely perfect and is the computer I want to sync from below if somebody wants to explain to me how I can get that data and add it to this post so you guys can compare and figure out what the heck the problem is I will do it. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",hillvalleyfarms
