I would like to run an external application when people click on such links. </p><p>What I have done so far: step #A1: In ""about:config"", I created and set the key ""network.protocol-handler.expose.ictfast"" to false. step #A2: I clicked on a link ""ictfast:xxxxxx"" step #A3: A box appeared letting me choose my external application </p><p>After these steps, if I click on a ""ictfast"" link, the application runs but I can't access the content in ""xxxxxx"". </p><p>To reproduce this, it is very simple: step #B1: open Automator step #B2: create a new Application step #B3: add the ""Run Shell Script"" actions step #B4: choose ""Pass input"" to as arguments"" step #B5: remove the default content of the shell script step #B6: type in `echo ""$@"" &gt; /tmp/args.txt` (without the backticks) step #B7: save and choose this app in step #A3 </p><p>Now if you click on a ""ictfast"" link, the file in ""/tmp/args.txt"" is created, but is empty. There is no arguments passed to the applications. </p><p>I was naively believing that when clicking on a ""ictfast"" link, Firefox would internally run the command `/foo/bar/whatever.app ""address""`.

My old laptop died the other day and so I bought a new one and put my old drive in an enclosure.  I had my Firefox heavily customised (over the past eight years) and I don't know how to transfer it over.  It used to be that I would just copy the users over and everything would be cool (XP to W7 didn't give me this problem) but it's not working this time.  My guess is that it's because my old laptop used Windows 7 Ultimate x64.  My desktop monster uses Windows 10 Pro but this new laptop uses Windows 10 Home (which is just awful compared to Pro) so there's probably an issue with how the user profiles are handled.  I didn't have a Firefox account because I didn't want every machine I use to have the same Firefox setup.  This was because my desktop and laptop are used for different purposes entirely. </p><p>Does anyone know how to import the settings from a Windows 7 profile to a Windows 10 profile?
