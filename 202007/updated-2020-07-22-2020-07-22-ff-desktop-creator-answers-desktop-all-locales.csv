How do I disable webp?,"<p>I'd like it if Firefox would automatically convert webp images to jpg or png files instead of the opposite... stop trying to save png or jpg files as webp... and stop serving me webp images when it is optional.

There have been several websites over the last few weeks that I have visited, and even if the image in the URL is named jpg or png, Firefox tries to save it as a webp. This is complicating my image saving process. I am using the Add-on named ""Save webP as PNG or JPEG"" which works, but slows down my saving process considerably. The Add-on does not remember the last folder I saved an image to, and adds several additional clicks to what used to be a simple process. </p><p>Is there a way in about:config to prevent Firefox from putting webp as the default file format in the Save Image As dialog box? </p><p>Suggesting that I use Internet Explorer or Edge is crazy.
