It happened after 1,5 month after new install (after windows reinstall), it has happened before and the case is the same. I have a laptop's OS reinstall (Windows) and i installed firefox as secondary web browser, it's fine at first but after sometimes the problem appears. Below i included a screenshot of the task manager. Why is it happening and is there any possible fix? i've already reset firefox and also do a clean install but the problem still persist. </p><p>Thank you, </p>",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",hafizhalhuda

It seems to be triggered when I click on Firefox to open it as the below then occurs.  At first I thought it was dues to the new MS Edge (firefox is my default browser, but then I noticed that the laptop was ok until I clicked on Firefox.  This may be just coincidental but seems to be the trigger.  </p><p>For several weeks or more, MS edge seems to have taken over the laptop - Edge opens of its own accord and begins to open up tens and tens of tabs about Get help with Windows 10.   I have to close the windows and MS Edge but it soon reopens and the issue repeats itself. </p><p>As i can not delete Edge, I have reinstalled Edge but it is just the same.   I have run a Malwarebytes scan but nothing was reported and similarly with a Bitdefender scan.  I have also updated the drivers.   </p><p>I thought that maybe if I try to use Edge to go to a web site or make an inquiry (it might become pacified and behave!) I can only usually type the first character and then the Windows Settings window opens and meanwhile Edge displays tens and tens of tabs re get help with windows etc. </p><p>The laptop had Wind 10 installed between 1 - 2 years agon from Win 7.  Win version now is 10 Home 1909 it has not updated any other win updates since Jan 20 apart from a very small one in the last week suggested from a scan but that made no difference to the issues above. </p><p>Edge is not the default browser because of all the issues.  Occasionally a message pops up about a software violation but the refeerences given re address etc seem to be different each time and the message goes off quickly so little chance to make a note of the ref numbers.. </p><p>Any ideas of  what I can try as it is really making the laptop of little use currently. </p><p>I am not very technical  so please bear that in mind in your replies </p>",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1334555;,JimHR

There is no home internet available and the cell phone service is poor - my only option is to tether my cell phone to be a wi-fi hotspot, but because we are down in the valley relative to the nearest cell phone towers, even this leads to frequent interrupted connections.  I often get the message 'No internet access, connected' from my wi-fi connection.   </p><p>With that situation, how can I set up Firefox to best deal with that reality?  In the Netscape days, when universal internet was a rarity, there was a switch for 'text only'.  Does that still exist?  What else is there to help Firefox out in this situation?   </p><p>I go into town once a day, and use the open wi-fi from either the library or a coffeeshop for anything that requires uploads, downloads, or streaming.  There's an assumption out there that everyone has strong internet access 24/7, and so programmers and designers no longer seem capable of accommodating people with poor connectivity.  I would say that this lack of internet is a common problem all across rural Canada, and there doesn't seem to be anything going on to fix it in the immediate future. </p><p>All advice gratefully accepted.

Am I expecting too much or is this not the way its supposed to work? It honestly feels like the auto sync works to some extent but its only updating/syncing maybe once an hour while I browse. This issue is not not device specific. They all seem to have very slow or bugged sync use where the most recent tabs are not synced unless they have been open for a very long time. </p><p>What are the events that trigger a sync if any and/or can I manually set the frequency at which it auto syncs? I really sucks when I leave a page open at the office for 10 minutes shut down and go home and its not synced. None of these devices have any internet connection issues and everything else seems to work just fine. I am also running the latest as of Friday version of Firefox on all my devices.

When I have a certain number of tabs open it stops just short of scrolling all the way down. Leaving the bottom of the bookmarks pop up open with the rest unavabile to reach. </p><p>2) It will not save any of my history and yes I have checked the ""Remember browsing and download history"" and the ""Remember search and form history"" and it still has not saved my history of any sites. </p><p>3) Previously if i had a tab up it would inform me of the website on that tab and take me there if i tried to search that same article, video, etc. For example is I had a tab already open of Kobe Bryant highlights (R.I.P.) then if i tried to type that same video in another tab it would lead me to the tab I already have opened. It currently isn't doing that. (Example Below) </p><p>4) In the history tab at the top it show a short history of sites I went to before the reinstall but it won't update for new sites. So there has to be a file somewhere keeping that information. I want to find it. </p><p>5)Finally a lot of the issues I've described I haven't found a simple solution for that involves MacBooks. So if anyone has an answer please tell me step by step what I should do in the Mac version. </p><p>I use Firefox to do a lot of legal research and I normally have anywhere from 25-50 tabs up from different statutes, cases, articles, etc. I need help so I can effectively research without constantly searching through each tab and never being able to bookmark or save anything.  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",other;firefox-780;desktop;mac-os;,firefox,other,en-US,1334023;1334025;1334030;1334031;1334079;1334149;,va52248715

Its default value is 900000, which would be 15 mins. The browser most definitely does not ask for the master password after 15 mins.

Likewise with ""UBlock"", as the screenshot below shows, here there is more than the weird little triangle, but the display is empty. Or when I click on the PermaCC add-on nothing happens when , usually, the PermaCC site opens up. On some websites, I can't even get small within-site pop-ups to show up (like when I want to see a password on LastPass, I click on the icon but nothing happens).  Any help would be much appreciated.
