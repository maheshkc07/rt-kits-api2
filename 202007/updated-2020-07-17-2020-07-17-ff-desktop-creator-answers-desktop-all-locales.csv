No longer different PDF handling for in-browser vs. Download panela,"<p>On FF v78.0.2 (Win 10/64-bit), it used to be that I could open PDF links within a website using FF's built-in PDF Viewer.  However, after saving them to disk, when I opened the PDF from the Downloads panel, it would open in my preferred 3rd party app.  This was desired and worked perfectly. </p><p>But this seems to have changed!  I either have to commit to the built-in always, or an external app always, irrespective of whether I am opening from a browser link or the download panel. </p><p>This is a terrible behavior.  FF should open PDFs in the download handler (like ALL other file types there) with the OS's preferred PDF handler, which, in my case, is not FF's built-in Viewer. </p><p>If open a PDF in the built-in Viewer and save it from there, why would I want to re-open it in the built-in PDF viewer when opening from the download panel?  </p><p>FF's built-in Viewer is great for a quick view of a PDF, I quite like it.  But if I take the time to save it, I typically want more advanced functionality, like highlighting, filling in forms, etc.  It worked perfectly before, please revert and stop fixing things that aren't broken.  Or at least differentiate between the download panel and website links.  Is there any hope in submitting a bug report? </p>",firefox-780;customize;desktop;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1333666;1333683;,vexware

Of late, I have observed that the Twitter's display settings which I set in my Twitter A/c settings (by using the More-&gt;Display option doesn't save the display settings I set for the Twitter account. Every time I close and open the FF browser, it reverts to the default arge font and blue colour setting which I dislike and prefer to set it to the smallest font size and a color of my choice.  This seems to be happening after my browser was upgraded to Version 78 (or 78.0.2) so something in this new version seems to reject my Twitter display settings for some reason. Would be grateful if someone can help fix this. Thanks. </p><p>Ramesh </p>",websites;firefox-780;desktop;windows-81;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",rameshiyer
