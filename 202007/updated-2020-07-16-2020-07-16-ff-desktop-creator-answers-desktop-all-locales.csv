I've read many posts talking about a 'Params' tab, but I don't seem to have a tab with that name and have always found parameters under the Request tab. I don't recall downloading any updates, and I don't use any add ons. It just simply says ""No parameters for this request"" - despite being 100% certain there were parameters. I attempted several uninstall and reinstall attempts, but was never able to get them to reappear. </p><p>I switched to regular Firefox (Currently on version 78.0.2) and the problem was not present, until earlier this week.
