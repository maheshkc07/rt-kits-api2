My old laptop died the other day and so I bought a new one and put my old drive in an enclosure.  I had my Firefox heavily customised (over the past eight years) and I don't know how to transfer it over.  It used to be that I would just copy the users over and everything would be cool (XP to W7 didn't give me this problem) but it's not working this time.  My guess is that it's because my old laptop used Windows 7 Ultimate x64.  My desktop monster uses Windows 10 Pro but this new laptop uses Windows 10 Home (which is just awful compared to Pro) so there's probably an issue with how the user profiles are handled.  I didn't have a Firefox account because I didn't want every machine I use to have the same Firefox setup.  This was because my desktop and laptop are used for different purposes entirely. </p><p>Does anyone know how to import the settings from a Windows 7 profile to a Windows 10 profile?  So far, I've had no luck whatsoever.  Thanks! </p>",desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-790;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",avroarrow69

I have tried to reset my password several times but the """"Master Password Box """"  keeps popping up (even while typing this) and none of my previous nor current passwords open it and it's required before i can login to access any of my data and passwords etc.. Which i do not know what the password is anymore. I did know it bc i typed it in several times a day.... either Microsoft update or Mozz update happened and that password is useless now and i can not afford to lose this information!!! As stated, I'm losing biz as i type PLUS i can't pay my bills until I get back into my data. My IPhone and iPad and other devices are all caught up in this mess as well. I feel absolutely hopeless! One would think if you donate several hundred $ a year to Mozz and you'd think there would be some sort priority support for Donors.  My other devices can't sign in either... Ive tried most everything I've seen in support and nothing seems to work. I feel as though the more i mess with it the deeper I'm sinking! I have a back up that is from 2018 which gaps the last 2 years of data and PW.. I Still have my old recovery key password that didn't work in the beginning when all of this happened, nor does windows master password work. I have everything backed up on a hard drive as well but I haven't gone down that road yet. I've been at this infinite loop for over a week now and I need some serious help please!! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-780;firefox-7802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ahines216

It's really glitchy sometimes; either it doesn't show up at all, then I have to manually copy paste my login data, or it moves around on the page when I scroll down, open up the keyboard etc. </p><p>So I thought, why not use Google's autofill, the feature I've always loved, because it works just perfectly, on Firefox instead. Did that on my tablet and mobile phone, as luckily you can select your autofill provider on Android. Sadly there's no option on Firefox so far (or I missed it, I quickly went through about:config but couldn't find anything there as well)... Maybe there's some hidden option or a safe addon that lets me do that? </p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated!

I also can't tell if there is one sole cause of all of these issues or several, but please do your best to explain what's going on. </p><p>1-2 months ago, some strange things started happening with my computer repeatedly. Consistently, a command prompt would open unexpectedly, saying something about Chromium failing to update. I couldn't do anything with that program, so I just X'd it out, and maybe around a minute later Firefox would crash and restart. Once that happened, my Firefox home page would be set to <a href=""http://Yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo.com</a>, and the default search engine would also be changed to Yahoo!. And on my desktop, shortcuts for Internet Explorer and Chromium would be added, and the shortcut for Chromium would be automatically pinned to my taskbar. </p><p>Windows Security would then notify me that it's blocked a threat, so I'd go to check it out and remove said threat. Every time, it;d say the blocked threat makes changes to browser settings without proper permission, and the blocked threat is called ""sodecitot.exe"", located in a filepath like c:\programdata\{5b729525-380e-6a38-89c28-8402d0dace36}\sodecitot.exe (just in case it's some obscure ID, I've swapped out those numbers and letters with random numbers and letters). Then Windows Security reports ""Remediation incomplete"" on the same threat, implying it attempted to restore itself. That letter and number folder name notably follows the same format as a bunch of folders which were last modified when I first turned on this computer on January 1, 2019. </p><p>I was getting a lot of such reports from Windows Security on very similar threats, having various different letters and numbers for their folder names, and I figured it was likely malware, so I made several full scans with MSERT, Malwarebytes, Windows Security, and Windows Defender Online Scan, all to no avail. </p><p>I don't even know why Internet Explorer is installed, but its files were last modified in February 2019, so I think it's just a shortcut that was added. </p><p>I'm not sure what Chromium is or why it's installed either. I tried to look it up to learn more about it but found nothing useful, and its executable looks like a blue version of Google Chrome's logo. Some parts of Chromium's installation were last modified in October 2019, but most of its files were modified just today. </p><p>Notably as well, when these problems started happening 1-2 months ago, there were two instances of all of my desktop shortcuts having weird visual issues, one being the little arrows on the shortcuts (which indicates it's a shortcut and not an actual file) being replaced with a X's, and a separate instance where the Audacity logo was over top every other shortcut for a few minutes. </p><p>With the same events happening today, a new error message opened, saying something about Windows Explorer attempting to load the C runtime library incorrectly (screenshot included). </p><p>I also considered turning to Mozilla, Google, and/or Microsoft support when this was originally happening, but then it suddenly stopped. I had a bunch of screenshots of some of the weirder things, but since nothing was happening for a while I deleted them. Now, 1-2 months later, it's starting right back up and I don't know why. I suspect it all links back to Chromium, but I'm not sure if I can just delete its files and call it quits, because I don't know if it's supposed to be there. It seems like something by Google, but I can't even confirm that. </p><p>So yeah. Any suggestions? </p><p><br> </p><p>My computer has a Windows 10 operating system. Mozilla Firefox is installed and constantly open, used for entertainment. Google Chrome is installed and constantly open, used for work. Apparently, some part of Google Chrome's installation trips off Malwarebytes whenever I make a scan. Removing it causes Chrome to crash, and once I open it again that part is replaced. Usually, I just remove it so I don't miss any other threats, and then just restore my closed tabs. Audacity is installed and has a desktop shortcut. Internet Explorer is apparently installed, and there is no uninstall executable as far as I can tell. Whatever it is, Chromium seems to keep trying to install itself, with parts of it already existing on my computer. </p>",desktop;other;malware;escalate;windows-10;escalationresolved;firefox-780;malware78;,firefox,other,en-US,1336551;1336552;1336826;1336845;1336854;,jcclay1

I cannot access Reddit through Firefox. </p><p>I don't get a message saying ""Unable to connect"" or ""Cannot access that website."" All I see is a blank screen. I have no problem accessing any other website (I've gone through every bookmark I have) and I can access Reddit using Edge (the only other browser I have installed). </p><p>I've already tried disabling all my addons, clearing my cache, cookies and data, and changing the network settings in the options of Firefox to No Proxy and to the other DNS option. Nothing works. All I see is a blank screen. </p><p>I am at a loss here as it feels like Firefox is preventing me from accessing this one website but isn't giving a reason why. </p><p>Edit: Solved </p><p><a href=""https://firefox-storage-test.glitch.me/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firefox-storage-test.glitch.me/</a> </p><p>Using the above test I was able to determine that nearly everything was full broken. Only local storage was functioning. After doing a reset on Firefox, everything is working again. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-780;firefox-7802;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",kdanielson1
