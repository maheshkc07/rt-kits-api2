I have to fill many fields of text in wordpress frequently on a daily basis. Almost all of these values appear as suggestions below the text field once I click on it, just like a drop down menu (but not a drop down menu, it actually works in proper menus). Previously, when I would hover over the selections, it would highlight them, letting me know exactly what I would be clicking prior to clicking it. Now that option is gone (with the new update) and I have to guess or look really closely to see where exactly the pointer is pointing, with a hit and miss result. Can you please bring back the ability to highlight the text suggestions? Or show me a way to re-enable it if that's possible. Thanks. ",firefox-780;desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,en-US

I have No problems in using it, neither I have I forgot my master password, my issue is the speed its taking to prompt for it, when I don't even intend to open a website that its holding login details for? Example:  When I am typing some info into the search box I very often find password prompt has picked up some of my search text instead of the search box, because I am looking at the keyboard not the screen I don't notice till its grabbed half my search question.   I don't like to keep the browser open all the time, only when I need to search Google. So each time I open it Its taking between 5 and 10 seconds before the password Box prompt pops in, even though I don't need it too? The cache is automatically set to clear on browser close, I don't believe  its PC speed related as Its a I7 Processor and everything is fine speed-wise.

This leaves me wondering if and how much overlap there is between these privacy protection plugins and Firefox tracking protection and if having both or multiple of these enabled, isn't simply overkill? To illustrate, I have tracking protection set to strict. In addition, I use EFF Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin, NoScript and DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials. If I have Firefox tracking protection set to strict, do I still need Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin and DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials? These seem to cover the same functionality but one may be better than the other. How do I know which to choose? (NoScript is more a security feature, so that's another matter).

The same happens for both OS. A few days ago (not at the latest update, but maybe the one before that?), the behaviour regarding PDF files changed. Before: When clicking on a link to a PDF file, it was opened in Firefox. When I downloaded it and then clicked on the file in the ""Downloads"" section, the local, downloaded file was opened in my system's PDF viewer.  After: After downloading, when I click on the file in the ""Downloads"" section, the local, downloaded file is opened in Firefox again. The system default for opening PDF files has not changed, i.e., when I open a PDF file locally from the file system, it opens in the PDF viewer, and not in Firefox. Changing how PDF files should be opened in ""Settings - Content"" does change the behaviour for both cases simultaneously. Is there any way to change this back to the old behaviour?
