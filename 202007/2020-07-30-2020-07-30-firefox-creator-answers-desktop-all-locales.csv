I recently backed up my Mozilla Roaming and Local profiles to an external drive before replacing the hard drive in my laptop. I also separately made a backup of my bookmarks.

After I opened it I synced and it seems that all my bookmarks, etc came back. The only two problems: 1) All my hundreds of bookmark favicons had been replaced with a generic globe. 2) My last session (which had scores of tabs), was not restored. So I tried copying and pasting the saved profiles back into the new Mozilla Roaming and Local profiles, but I can't get Firefox to access them.  Instead, it only accesses the new profile. I did an uninstall and tried it again, but all I ended up doing is creating another new profile. Now when I go to About:Profiles (see image), the default-release and default profiles listed don't seem to exist anymore (they aren't loadable, and they can't be found using the filepath noted there), and the actual backup profiles that I copied from my portable drive into Mozilla and that I actually see in File Explorer, doesn't show up as a profile choice.
